# Akella Satya Vijay — AI Developer Portfolio 🚀

**Personal portfolio & technical showcase**
A focused, modern portfolio highlighting my AI work: deep learning, Generative AI, production-ready ML systems, and full-stack demos. Designed to be fast, responsive, and recruiter-friendly — with an interactive AI assistant and clear evidence of impact.

## Quick pitch

I build practical AI systems that move from idea → prototype → production. I combine solid fundamentals (ML/DL), applied knowledge (RAG, LLMs, model fine-tuning), and clean engineering (MLOps, REST APIs, client-side integrations) to ship usable, well-documented solutions.

## Highlights

* ✅ Production-minded AI developer (2.5+ years experience)
* ✅ Interactive AI assistant built with vanilla JS + CSS (widget included)
* ✅ Responsive, polished portfolio UI with animated, accessible components
* ✅ Focus domains: Generative AI, LLMs, CNNs, MLOps, Data Intelligence, RAG

## Selected Projects (featured on the site)

* **Interactive AI Assistant** — floating chat widget with wake/sleep micro-animations and simulated replies; lightweight and easily extensible to integrate real APIs.
* **Portfolio Demos** — code walkthroughs, live hosted demos, and downloadable CV.
* **Small-scale Production POCs** — model deployments, RAG pipelines and evaluation notes (design, latency tradeoffs, caching & batching strategies).

> Full project list and links are on the live portfolio (Projects / Work sections).

## Notes for maintainers / contributors

* Styling lives in `style.css`. AI widget styling & logic are included in `ai-widget` blocks inside `index.html` for simplicity.
* Use the `:root` CSS variables to tune colors (accent1, accent2, text, glass) to match branding.
* Keep the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag in `<head>` for mobile responsiveness.

---

## What I’m looking to build next

* Integrate a RAG assistant backed by private docs and secure API keys (server-side)
* Add a lightweight analytics dashboard capturing widget usage & project clicks
* Harden MLOps pipelines for reproducible model training and CI-driven deployments
